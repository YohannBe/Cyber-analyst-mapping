# Cyber-analyst-mapping

Hi guys !

When I just started in the Cybersecurity field I was quite lost (and the term is undermining what I felt the first month) and I'm pretty sure that a lot of folks in the Cyber field still feel the same!

Why ?

Simply because this field is a big and ever changing one !

Each day a new threat appear
Each day a new remediation/mitigation appear
From time to time a new "better" method appear on what and how to do our stuff

Then an idea crossed my mind.
We, the threat hunters, the safeguarder of data, look for what is not regular, what, in other term, is different from the baseline.
Following this approach, I have started to write a mind map with 2 goals in mind:

1: Exposing the baseline of the Cybersecurity Analyst
2: Exposing the tools and command used for each use case

This mind map is not something that one need to learn by heart, it is something that will be used more as a check list, as a reminder, as an indicator of where to start when there is just so much to tackle !

Moreover, even though the closest branches to the center won't move a lot, I expect that the extremities (tools and commands) will move quite frequently, which is good since it means that the map will not stay static but in the contrary, will adapt and stay as much up to date as possible.

What I wrote on this map for now is based on what I have learned with OpenClassrooms, Mathieu Vajou, David Bombal, NetworkChuck, ITPro, from ACI Learning and from my own experience at ResilEyes Therapeutics.

Thanks Xmind for the software, was straghtforward, easy to use and served my purpose to perfection.

(I am only at 1/5 of the map and it is already huge).

You can modified the XMIND file then upluoad it to a new branch that will be checked before merging, the file is: Analyst Cyber.xmind
